# Intro to Unit Testing

- Can you think of something where we test the product before we buy the product?
- Have you ever coded a new feature, only to have something that previously worked, break?
- Have you ever spent hours debugging something, only to find it was a small typo or logic error?
- Have you ever been afraid to refactor code because you weren't sure what might break?
- If your project grew 10x in size, how would you make sure everything still worked?
- What would happen if your app broke and users noticed before you did?

What is software testing and why is it important?

# Types of Testing

- Unit Tests: Tests the smallest parts of code (ex: functions) in isolation
   - competing tools: Jest, Mocha/Chai, Vitest
- Integration Tests: Ensures that combined parts of an app work together
   - tools: Jest, Mocha/Chai, Vitest, react-testing-library, Playwright
- End-to-End Tests: Simulates real user scenarios from start to finish
   - tools: Playwright, Cypress
- Ask ChatGPT:
   - What is the most popular testing library for node apps?
   - List developer testing tools in chronological order (ex: jest, mocha chai)

# Debugging and Testing Routes

- Identify tools you might use to normally test a route like this:
```js
app.get('/api/trucks', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'List of food trucks' });
});
```
- What do you think would change if you had a way to automatically test parts of your app every time you updated it?
- `npm init -y`
- `npm i -D jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-jest`
- Change package.json:
   ```json
    "scripts": {
      "test": "jest",
      "test:watch": "jest --watch"
    },
   ```
   - run `git init` otherwise "watch" won't work

# Exercise: Writing Unit Tests (pg.1)

```js
// first.test.js
describe('first test', () => {
    it('should work', () => {
        expect(true).toBe(true)
    });

    it('should be 4', () => {
        expect(1 + 1).toBe(2)
    })
})
```
- `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`
- try breaking a test to see what happens (ex: `expect(2 + 2).toBe(5)`)
- https://jestjs.io/docs/expect

# Exercise: Writing Unit Tests (pg.2)

- FILL IN THE BLANK
```js
// math.js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// math.test.js
import { add } from '../math.js';

describe('add()', () => {
  it('should add two numbers', () => {
    expect(________).toBe(5);
  });
});
```

# Show a google map based off lat/lng coordinates

- We need to adjust our schema to include location etc.
- let's move our choices to truckController as a const
- adjust our addTruck form and editTruck form to include location
- add autocomplete functionality for address
- add slug page
- make static google map based off our lat/lng
- ensure slug is unique

---

# Create tags page

- create `getTags` route
- add `.getAllTags()` method to Truck schema
- make clicking each tag filter and display corresponding food trucks with tag
